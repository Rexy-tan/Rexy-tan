Hi! Im rexynn and i want to learn how to develop websites and be a full-stack developer. I'm starting on the front end. My goal is to keep updating the website as my knowledge expands. 

#firstversion is me using basic html css that I learned in 1.5 month, I learned a lot and tried to put it on my website. I am currently looking into more css styling to achieve the design i have in mind.

Once i am satisfied with the look that can be done with CSS (I was thinking of some abstract-shaped containers and card thingies)I don't want to just search up the code for it and copy and paste. i want to actually understand it before using it. i will start learning javascript. 

Learning how to code and actually using it is pretty awesome. it is definitely a rollercoaster of emotions. but seeing the randome things i type turn into something is a great feeling. hopefully i can make some really cool things in the future!

Speacial thanks to chatgpt not only did it answer my very repetitive coding questions but was also my therapist on the side!
